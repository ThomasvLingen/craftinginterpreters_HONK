# Crafting interpreters: HONK interpreter
This is an interpreter written for the HONK language, a slightly modified version of the lox language used in the [crafting interpreters book](http:/craftinginterpreters.com/).

Another key difference is that this interpreter is written in (post)modern C++17.

### Usage
```
honk [OPTIONS] [FILENAME]

Where OPTIONS is one of:
	--debug		Debug mode, prints out intermediate representations (Tokens, AST, etc.)

Specifying no filename drops you into REPL mode.
```
